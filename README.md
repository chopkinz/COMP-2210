# COMP-2210 Fundamentals of Computing II

Hands-Ons labs and Assigments completed for COMP-2210. This is the data structures and algorithms course at Auburn, and it is one of the cornerstone courses for several majors, including Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In this course, you will learn about developing programs that use data structures and collections to efficiently store data. Emphasis will be placed on the interplay between effective data structures and efficient algorithms.
